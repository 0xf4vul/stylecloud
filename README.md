# stylecloud

Generate stylistic wordclouds, including gradients and icon shapes!

stylecloud is a Python package extends the popular wordcloud package, adding useful features to create truly unique word clouds!

* Icon shapes (via Font Awesome 5.11.2)
* Support for custom icon font files (e.g. Font Awesome Pro)
* Directional gradients
* Command Line Interface

## Helpful Notes

* The primary goal of this package is to create data visualizations of text that provide a unique aesthetic. Word clouds have tradeoffs in terms of a persuasive data visualization, but this is explicitly trying to create a viz that looks cool!
* This package is released as a separate package from `wordcloud` due to the increase in scope and Python dependencies.
